Formula PM 3.0 - Complete AI Agent Implementation Guide
üìã Project Overview Prompt
You are building Formula PM 3.0 - a modern construction project management system. This is a FRESH START project that keeps the excellent database but rebuilds the application layer with clean, modern patterns.

CONTEXT:
- Formula PM V2 has over-engineering issues (448-line useAuth hook, complex abstractions)
- Database schema is excellent and will be kept with minor enhancements
- Target users: Construction teams, project managers, architects, clients
- Focus: Clean code, fast navigation, flexible permissions, mobile-friendly

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Navigation speed like smooth modern apps (< 500ms between pages)
- Flexible permission system (admin-configurable, no code deployments)
- Professional UI for client meetings, mobile-ready for field workers
- Simple, maintainable codebase (opposite of V2 complexity)

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack Prompt
BUILD FORMULA PM 3.0 WITH THIS EXACT TECH STACK:

CORE STACK (Approved):
- Framework: Next.js 15 with App Router (NOT Pages Router)
- Database: Keep existing Supabase PostgreSQL schema (it's excellent)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui components
- Language: TypeScript throughout
- Authentication: Supabase Auth (but simplified implementation)

STRATEGIC ADDITIONS:
- Data Management: @tanstack/react-query (for caching, background updates)
- Forms: react-hook-form + zod (construction forms are complex)  
- Charts: recharts (for Gantt charts, progress tracking)
- Icons: lucide-react (consistent, construction-friendly)

DEPLOYMENT TARGET:
- Primary: Vercel (zero-config Next.js deployment)
- Alternative: Azure Static Web Apps (if Azure ecosystem required)
- NO DOCKER (unnecessary complexity for this stack)

AVOID:
- Complex state management (React Query handles most needs)
- Over-abstracted components (keep simple)
- Route-level permission blocking (use component-level filtering)

üîë Revolutionary RBAC System Prompt
IMPLEMENT DYNAMIC PERMISSION SYSTEM (This is the key innovation):

DATABASE CHANGES (Enhance existing schema):
1. ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN permissions TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}'
2. ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN job_title TEXT (descriptive only)
3. ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN department TEXT (descriptive only)
4. CREATE TABLE permission_templates (...) (for admin management)
5. CREATE TABLE permission_changes (...) (for audit trail)

CORE CONCEPT:
- NO MORE FIXED ROLES! Roles become descriptive text only
- Real access control through permissions array
- Same job title can have different permissions per company
- Admin panel manages permissions, not code changes

PERMISSION EXAMPLES:
user.permissions = [
  'create_projects', 'view_project_costs', 'internal_review_drawings', 
  'submit_to_client', 'approve_expenses', 'admin_panel_access'
]

COMPONENT USAGE:
```tsx
const { hasPermission } = usePermissions()

return (
  <div>
    <h1>{project.name}</h1>
    {hasPermission('view_project_costs') && (
      <p>Budget: ${project.budget}</p>
    )}
    {hasPermission('edit_projects') && (
      <Button>Edit Project</Button>
    )}
  </div>
)
This approach gives ultimate flexibility - construction companies can customize access exactly to their needs without calling for code changes.

## üé® **User Interface & Experience Prompt**
CREATE PROJECT WORKSPACE PATTERN (This UX design is excellent):
URL STRUCTURE:
/projects                    # Project list page
/projects/[id]              # Project workspace (tabbed interface)
/projects/[id]/scope        # Scope items management
/projects/[id]/drawings     # Shop drawings workflow
/projects/[id]/tasks        # Task management
/projects/[id]/gantt        # Gantt chart timeline
/projects/[id]/documents    # Document management
/projects/[id]/reports      # Project reports
FOLDER STRUCTURE:
src/app/projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                    # Project list
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [id]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx              # Project workspace layout (header + tabs)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx                # Project overview/dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scope/page.tsx          # Scope management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ drawings/page.tsx       # Shop drawings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/page.tsx          # Task management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gantt/page.tsx          # Gantt chart
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/page.tsx        # Reports
UI LIBRARY: Use Shadcn/ui + Tailwind

Professional look for client meetings
Touch-friendly for field workers with work gloves
Fast loading on construction site internet
Mobile-responsive for tablets and phones
Easy to customize for company branding

USER FLOW:
Login ‚Üí Projects List ‚Üí Click Project ‚Üí Project Workspace (stay in project context while switching between tabs like scope, drawings, tasks, etc.)

## üîÑ **Authentication Simplification Prompt**
REPLACE COMPLEX AUTHENTICATION WITH SIMPLE SYSTEM:
CURRENT PROBLEM: V2 has 448-line useAuth hook doing everything
TARGET SOLUTION: Clean, focused hooks under 50 lines each
useAuth Hook (20-30 lines max):
tsxexport const useAuth = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null)
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<UserProfile | null>(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
      setUser(session?.user ?? null)
      if (session?.user) fetchProfile(session.user.id)
      setLoading(false)
    })

    const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
      async (event, session) => {
        setUser(session?.user ?? null)
        if (session?.user) await fetchProfile(session.user.id)
      }
    )
    return () => subscription.unsubscribe()
  }, [])

  return { user, profile, loading, signIn, signOut, isAuthenticated: !!user && !!profile }
}
usePermissions Hook (separate concern):
tsxexport const usePermissions = () => {
  const { profile } = useAuth()
  
  const hasPermission = (permission: string) => {
    return profile?.permissions?.includes(permission) || false
  }
  
  return { hasPermission }
}
PRINCIPLES:

Each hook has single responsibility
No impersonation complexity in core auth
No manual token refresh (let Supabase handle it)
No complex caching (React Query handles data)
Server Components handle auth checks where possible

## üîÑ **Approval Workflows Implementation Prompt**
IMPLEMENT SHOP DRAWING APPROVAL WORKFLOW (Example of permission-driven workflows):
WORKFLOW STAGES:

Architect creates drawing ‚Üí 2. Internal review ‚Üí 3. Submit to client ‚Üí 4. Client review ‚Üí 5. Approve/Reject

DATABASE STATUS TRACKING:
shop_drawings table with status field:

'draft' ‚Üí 'internal_review' ‚Üí 'internal_approved' ‚Üí 'submitted_to_client' ‚Üí 'client_approved'/'client_rejected'

PERMISSION-BASED ACTIONS:
tsxfunction ShopDrawingCard({ drawing }) {
  const { hasPermission } = usePermissions()

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{drawing.drawing_number}</CardTitle>
        <StatusBadge status={drawing.status} />
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        {/* Actions based on status and permissions */}
        {drawing.status === 'draft' && hasPermission('submit_for_internal_review') && (
          <Button onClick={() => updateStatus('internal_review')}>
            Submit for Internal Review
          </Button>
        )}
        
        {drawing.status === 'internal_review' && hasPermission('internal_review_drawings') && (
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Button onClick={() => updateStatus('internal_approved')}>Approve</Button>
            <Button variant="destructive" onClick={() => updateStatus('revision_needed')}>
              Request Changes
            </Button>
          </div>
        )}
        
        {drawing.status === 'submitted_to_client' && hasPermission('review_submitted_drawings') && (
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Button onClick={() => updateStatus('client_approved')}>Client Approve</Button>
            <Button variant="destructive" onClick={() => updateStatus('client_rejected')}>
              Client Reject
            </Button>
          </div>
        )}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
WORKFLOW BENEFITS:

Different users see different actions based on their permissions
Flexible for different construction companies (some skip internal review, others have multi-stage approval)
Complete audit trail of who approved what when
Easy to add new workflow stages without code changes

## üéØ **Critical Success Factors Prompt**
ENSURE THESE SUCCESS CRITERIA:
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:

Navigation between project tabs: < 500ms (like smooth modern apps)
Initial page load: < 2 seconds
Mobile responsiveness: Works perfectly on tablets with work gloves
Construction site internet: Fast loading on poor connections

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:

Clients cannot see pricing data (permission-filtered)
Construction companies can customize permissions without code changes
Job titles are descriptive only - permissions control real access
Shop drawing approval workflows match industry standards
Mobile-first design for field workers

CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:

useAuth hook: < 50 lines (not 448 like V2)
Components: Simple, focused, single responsibility
No route-level permission blocking (use component-level filtering)
