# Critical Session Save: Role Migration Fix
**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Priority**: URGENT - Authentication Broken  
**Status**: In Progress - Ready for Final Script Execution

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE SUMMARY
- **Problem**: 406 "Not Acceptable" error when logging in with admin credentials
- **Root Cause**: Database has 13-role system, code expects 6-role system (Kiro's design)
- **Impact**: Cannot authenticate, app is unusable
- **User ID**: `e42c6330-c382-4ba8-89c1-35895dddc523` (from error logs)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION READY
**File**: `simple-deadlock-free-solution.sql` (READY TO RUN)

This script completes Kiro's 13→6 role migration:
1. Disables ALL RLS to prevent deadlocks
2. Drops ALL blocking policies  
3. Converts enum: 13 roles → 6 roles
4. Creates admin profile with `management` role
5. Re-enables minimal RLS

## 📋 PROGRESS COMPLETED
✅ **Steps 1-3** of role migration completed successfully
✅ **Enum renamed** to `user_role_old` 
✅ **New 6-role enum** created
✅ **Identified all blocking tables** (financial/tender tables with role policies)
✅ **Created deadlock-free solution**

## 🔄 WHAT TO DO NEXT
1. **Run `simple-deadlock-free-solution.sql`** in Supabase SQL editor
2. **Test admin login** with credentials
3. **Verify authentication works** without 406 errors

## 📂 KEY FILES CREATED
- `simple-deadlock-free-solution.sql` - **MAIN SOLUTION** (run this)
- `step-by-step-migration.sql` - Step-by-step approach (if needed)
- `fix-kiro-role-migration.sql` - Original attempt
- `remove-all-financial-tables.sql` - Table cleanup approach
- `check-role-enum.sql` - Diagnostic script

## 🧠 KIRO'S ROLE SYSTEM DESIGN
**Old 13 Roles** → **New 6 Roles**:
- `company_owner`, `general_manager`, `deputy_general_manager` → `management`
- `purchase_director`, `purchase_specialist` → `purchase_manager`
- `technical_director` → `technical_lead`
- `project_manager`, `architect`, `technical_engineer`, `field_worker` → `project_manager`
- `client` → `client` (unchanged)
- `admin` → `admin` (unchanged)

## 💡 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- **Frontend Code**: Already uses 6-role system (Kiro updated it)
- **Database**: Still has 13-role system (migration failed)
- **Migration Blocker**: RLS policies on unused financial/tender tables
- **Solution**: Temporarily disable ALL RLS, do migration, re-enable selectively

## 🔍 DIAGNOSIS COMPLETED
- ✅ Verified shop drawings are implemented (PRESERVE them)
- ✅ Found financial/tender tables are NOT implemented (safe to modify)
- ✅ Identified exact policy conflicts blocking migration
- ✅ Created comprehensive solution avoiding deadlocks

## 🎨 BONUS: COLOR SYSTEM MIGRATION
**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** (25/25 components)
- All components migrated to semantic color system
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Dark mode ready
- Comprehensive Badge variants implemented

## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT SESSION ACTIONS
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run `simple-deadlock-free-solution.sql`
2. Test admin authentication
3. Verify app functionality with 6-role system
4. Re-enable additional RLS policies if needed

## 📞 CONTINUATION NOTES
- User has admin credentials ready for testing
- All blocking policies identified and handled
- Shop drawings functionality preserved
- Core business tables maintained
- Only unused financial/tender features affected

**READY TO EXECUTE FINAL SOLUTION** 🚀
