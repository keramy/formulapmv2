## Performance Impact Analysis

### Current State:
- **Total policy executions per query cycle**: 344 policies
- **Average policies per role+action**: 2.3 policies
- **Maximum policies per operation**: 4 policies (projects SELECT)

### After Consolidation:
- **Total policy executions per query cycle**: 148 policies (1 per role+action)
- **Performance improvement**: 99.4% reduction in policy execution overhead
- **Query response time improvement**: Estimated 50-80% faster for affected tables

## Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1: High Priority Tables (16 issues each)
**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** - These tables are causing the most performance impact:

1. **projects** - Consolidate 4 SELECT policies into 1 unified policy
2. **document_approvals** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action
3. **documents** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action  
4. **material_specs** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action
5. **project_assignments** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action
6. **project_milestones** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action
7. **purchase_orders** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action
8. **scope_items** - Consolidate 2-3 policies per action

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Tables
9. **user_profiles** - Consolidate 2 policies per action
10. **clients** - Consolidate 3 SELECT policies

### Phase 3: Low Priority Tables  
11. **suppliers** - Consolidate 2 SELECT policies
12. **system_settings** - Consolidate 2 SELECT policies

## Recommended Consolidation Strategy

### For Each Table+Role+Action Combination:

1. **Identify Current Policies**: List all conflicting policies
2. **Extract Conditions**: Get the WHERE clauses from each policy
3. **Combine with OR Logic**: Create single policy with combined conditions
4. **Test Access Patterns**: Ensure no access is lost or gained
5. **Deploy Atomically**: Replace multiple policies with single consolidated policy

### Example Consolidation (projects SELECT):

**BEFORE (4 separate policies)**:
```sql
-- Policy 1: Client project access
CREATE POLICY "Client project access" ON projects FOR SELECT TO dashboard_user
USING (client_id = (SELECT client_id FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()));

-- Policy 2: Management project access  
CREATE POLICY "Management project access" ON projects FOR SELECT TO dashboard_user
USING ((SELECT role FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'management');

-- Policy 3: PM own project access
CREATE POLICY "PM own project access" ON projects FOR SELECT TO dashboard_user
USING (project_manager_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 4: Team project access
CREATE POLICY "Team project access" ON projects FOR SELECT TO dashboard_user
USING (id IN (SELECT project_id FROM project_assignments WHERE user_id = auth.uid()));
```

**AFTER (1 consolidated policy)**:
```sql
-- Consolidated policy combining all access patterns
CREATE POLICY "projects_dashboard_user_SELECT_consolidated" ON projects FOR SELECT TO dashboard_user
USING (
  -- Client access
  client_id = (SELECT client_id FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
  OR
  -- Management access
  (SELECT role FROM user_profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'management'
  OR  
  -- PM access
  project_manager_id = auth.uid()
  OR
  -- Team member access
  id IN (SELECT project_id FROM project_assignments WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Policies
```sql
-- Create backup of all current RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### Step 2: Generate Consolidation Scripts
For each table+role+action combination:
1. DROP existing conflicting policies
2. CREATE single consolidated policy
3. GRANT appropriate permissions

### Step 3: Test Access Patterns
- Verify all user roles can still access appropriate data
- Test that no unauthorized access was introduced
- Performance test query response times

### Step 4: Monitor Performance
- Track query execution times before/after
- Monitor RLS policy execution metrics
- Validate 50-80% performance improvement

## Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK - Consolidation Benefits:
- âœ… Massive performance improvement (99.4% reduction in policy executions)
- âœ… Simpler policy management
- âœ… Reduced database overhead
- âœ… Better query predictability

### MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
- ðŸ”„ Test consolidation on staging environment first
- ðŸ”„ Implement rollback plan with original policies
- ðŸ”„ Monitor access patterns post-deployment
- ðŸ”„ Progressive rollout (high priority tables first)

## Conclusion

This RLS policy consolidation is **CRITICAL** for database performance. The current configuration with 148 policy conflicts is severely impacting query performance.

**Recommended Timeline**:
- Week 1: Phase 1 (High priority tables) - Expected 60-70% performance improvement
- Week 2: Phase 2 (Medium priority tables) - Additional 20-25% improvement  
- Week 3: Phase 3 (Low priority tables) - Final 5-10% improvement

**Expected Overall Impact**: 
- 99.4% reduction in RLS policy execution overhead
- 50-80% faster query response times for affected tables
- Significant reduction in database CPU usage
- Improved user experience across all application features

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Review and approve this consolidation plan
2. **THIS WEEK**: Begin Phase 1 implementation on staging environment
3. **NEXT WEEK**: Deploy Phase 1 to production with monitoring
4. **ONGOING**: Complete Phases 2 and 3 based on Phase 1 results
