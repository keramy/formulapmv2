## Executive Summary

- **Total Policies**: 15
- **Need Optimization**: 8
- **Already Optimized**: 7
- **Progress**: 46.7%

## High Priority Tables

- **projects**: 3 policies need optimization (25% complete)
- **tasks**: 2 policies need optimization (33.3% complete)

## Recommendations

### HIGH Priority: Optimize direct auth function calls
8 policies contain direct auth.uid() or auth.jwt() calls that should be converted to subqueries
*Impact: Significant performance improvement for row-level security evaluation*

### HIGH Priority: Prioritize high-impact tables
Focus optimization efforts on: projects, tasks
*Impact: Maximum performance gain with focused effort*

### MEDIUM Priority: Complete systematic optimization
53.3% of policies still need optimization
*Impact: Comprehensive performance improvement across all tables*

## Next Steps

1. Review high-priority tables identified above
2. Execute systematic optimization using the pattern transformation engine
3. Validate security preservation after each optimization batch
4. Monitor performance improvements through Supabase Performance Advisor
