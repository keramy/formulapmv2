# Subagent Task: Analyze Planning App Implementation Status

## Task Overview
**Task Name**: analyze_planning_app_implementation_status
**Goal**: Comprehensively analyze all plans in @Planing App/ directory to identify unimplemented features and systems
**Context**: User wants to understand which planned features from the Planning App directory have not yet been implemented in the Formula PM system

## Requirements
1. Search and catalog all planning documents in @Planing App/ directory
2. Analyze each plan document to understand proposed features and systems
3. Cross-reference planned features against actual implementation in codebase
4. Identify which plans have been fully implemented
5. Identify which plans are partially implemented
6. Identify which plans have not been started
7. Create comprehensive status report of implementation gaps
8. Prioritize unimplemented plans by complexity and business value
9. Provide recommendations for next implementation priorities
10. Include specific file paths and technical details for verification

## Constraints
- DO NOT modify any existing code or plans
- Focus on analysis and gap identification only
- DO NOT implement any missing features during analysis
- AVOID making assumptions about implementation status without verification
- Use actual codebase inspection to verify implementation status

## Dependencies
None

## Decision Authority
- Report: Implementation gaps and missing features
- Recommend: Implementation priorities and approaches
- Analyze: Current system capabilities vs planned features

## Critical Constraints
- DO NOT add new features or remove existing features without explicit user approval
- DO NOT make assumptions about requirements - use Ambiguous Task Protocol if unclear
- Focus on analysis only - no implementation during this task
- Provide specific evidence from codebase for implementation status claims

## References
- @Planing App/ directory for all planning documents
- @src/ for actual implementation verification
- @Patterns/ for understanding implementation patterns
- Existing final reports for completed implementations

## Deliverables
Comprehensive implementation gap analysis with specific plans, features, and recommended next steps

## Execution Instructions
1. First, catalog all planning documents in the Planning App directory
2. For each plan, extract key features and systems proposed
3. Verify implementation status by searching the codebase
4. Document findings in a structured format
5. Prioritize unimplemented features by business value and complexity
6. Provide clear recommendations for next implementation priorities

Begin by exploring the Planning App directory structure and cataloging all planning documents.
