-- Fix Shop Drawings RLS Policies - Eliminate Multiple Permissive Policies
-- Created: 2025-01-24
-- Purpose: Consolidate RLS policies to prevent performance issues
-- Following established patterns: Separate policies by action type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

-- ============================================================================
-- DROP EXISTING OVERLAPPING POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Project team shop drawing access" ON shop_drawings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Architect shop drawing management" ON shop_drawings; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Client shop drawing view" ON shop_drawings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Client shop drawing approval" ON shop_drawings;

-- ============================================================================
-- CREATE OPTIMIZED RLS POLICIES (SEPARATED BY ACTION TYPE)
-- ============================================================================
