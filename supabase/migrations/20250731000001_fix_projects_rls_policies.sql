-- Fix Projects RLS Policies - Critical Bug Fix
-- Date: 2025-07-31
-- Issue: projects_select policy using get_user_accessible_projects() function 
--        was preventing authenticated users from accessing projects

-- Step 1: Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "projects_select" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "projects_insert" ON public.projects; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "projects_update" ON public.projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "projects_delete" ON public.projects;

-- Step 2: Create new optimized RLS policies using enterprise-grade patterns

-- SELECT Policy - Allow users to see projects they have access to
-- Uses (SELECT auth.uid()) pattern for 10-100x performance improvement
CREATE POLICY "projects_select_optimized" ON public.projects
  FOR SELECT USING (
    -- Admin and management can see all active projects
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
      WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) 
      AND role IN ('management', 'admin') 
      AND is_active = true
    )
    OR
    -- Project managers can see projects they manage
    (project_manager_id = (SELECT auth.uid()))
    OR
    -- Users assigned to projects can see them
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.project_assignments pa
      WHERE pa.project_id = projects.id
      AND pa.user_id = (SELECT auth.uid())
      AND pa.is_active = true
    )
    OR
    -- Clients can see their projects  
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles up
      JOIN public.clients c ON up.id = c.contact_user_id
      WHERE up.id = (SELECT auth.uid())
      AND c.id = projects.client_id
      AND up.role = 'client'
      AND up.is_active = true
    )
  );

-- INSERT Policy - Allow authorized users to create projects
CREATE POLICY "projects_insert_optimized" ON public.projects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
      WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) 
      AND role IN ('management', 'admin', 'project_manager') 
      AND is_active = true
    )
  );

-- UPDATE Policy - Allow authorized users to update projects  
CREATE POLICY "projects_update_optimized" ON public.projects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    -- Admin and management can update all projects
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
      WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) 
      AND role IN ('management', 'admin') 
      AND is_active = true
    )
    OR
    -- Project managers can update their own projects
    (project_manager_id = (SELECT auth.uid()) AND 
     EXISTS (
       SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
       WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) 
       AND role = 'project_manager' 
       AND is_active = true
     ))
  );

-- DELETE Policy - Only admin and management can delete
CREATE POLICY "projects_delete_optimized" ON public.projects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
      WHERE id = (SELECT auth.uid()) 
      AND role IN ('management', 'admin') 
      AND is_active = true
    )
  );

-- Step 3: Create index on project_manager_id for performance (if not exists)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_project_manager_id 
ON public.projects(project_manager_id) 
WHERE project_manager_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 4: Create index on project_assignments for RLS performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_project_assignments_user_project_active 
ON public.project_assignments(user_id, project_id, is_active) 
WHERE is_active = true;

-- Step 5: Verification and performance analysis
