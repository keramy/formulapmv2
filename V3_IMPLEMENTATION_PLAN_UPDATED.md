# Formula PM V3 - Comprehensive Implementation Plan (Updated)

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: 70% Complete (Previously estimated at 0% in original plan)  
**Objective**: Complete remaining V3 features and bridge API/UI gaps for full functionality

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

The original V3 implementation plan was **significantly outdated**. Deep codebase analysis reveals:

- **3 out of 6 P1 features are FULLY COMPLETE** (Tasks, Milestones, Materials)
- **1 P1 feature needs UI only** (Scope Management - API complete)
- **2 P1 features need implementation** (Shop Drawings, Reports)

**Real Status**: ~70% complete, not 0% as original plan suggested.
