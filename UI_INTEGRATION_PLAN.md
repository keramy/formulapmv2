### **Updated UI Integration Plan (Version 2)**

**Objective:** To complete and verify the integration of the application's UI with its powerful backend, ensuring all features are fully functional, navigable, and data-driven.

**Current Status Assessment:** Significant progress has been made on the UI front. The core challenge is no longer *creating* the UI from scratch, but **completing, connecting, and verifying** it. The new priority is to move from "in-progress" to "production-ready."

### **Priority 1: Complete and Verify Core Feature UIs**

The goal is to get the main project management features to a "Done" state. For each feature, the plan is to **Verify -> Connect -> Complete**.

#### **1. Task Management UI**

*   **Status:** **In Progress.** The `src/components/tasks` directory exists.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Verify:** Review the existing components in `src/components/tasks`. Confirm that the UI includes a task list, a creation/edit form, and a detail view with comments.
    2.  **Connect:** Ensure every UI action (create, update, delete, comment) is fully connected to its corresponding API endpoint under `/api/tasks/`.
    3.  **Complete:** Replace any remaining mock data with live data. Add loading states and error handling to provide a smooth user experience. Finalize the integration into a `TasksTab.tsx` component.

#### **2. Milestone Tracking UI**

*   **Status:** **In Progress.** The `src/components/milestones` directory exists.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Verify:** Review the components in `src/components/milestones`.
    2.  **Connect:** Ensure all UI elements for creating, editing, and updating milestones are fully wired to the `/api/milestones/` endpoints.
    3.  **Complete:** Remove all mock data, add loading/error states, and finalize the `MilestonesTab.tsx` component.

#### **3. Scope List UI**

*   **Status:** **In Progress.** The `src/components/scope` directory exists.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Verify:** Review the components in `src/components/scope`. Confirm that the UI supports the enhanced design from the plan (grouping by category, financial columns).
    2.  **Connect:** Wire up the UI to the backend, especially the new features like bulk supplier assignment and Excel import/export.
    3.  **Complete:** Ensure the manual group progress indicators and Millwork dependency indicators are functional.

### **Priority 2: Finalize Dashboards and Navigation**

#### **1. Refine Project Manager Dashboard**

*   **Status:** **In Progress.** The `src/components/dashboard` directory exists.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Verify:** Review the existing dashboard components.
    2.  **Connect:** Connect the `MyTasksAndActions`, `RecentProjectActivity`, and `CriticalAlerts` components to the live data from the `/api/dashboard/` and `/api/tasks/` endpoints.
    3.  **Complete:** Ensure the dashboard provides a real-time, actionable overview for the Project Manager.

#### **2. Solidify Navigation**

*   **Status:** **Partially Complete.** The `src/app` structure is good.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Verify:** Manually click through the application to ensure the navigation flow is logical.
    2.  **Complete:** Add the links for the `Tasks`, `Milestones`, and `Scope` tabs to the main project workspace navigation bar. Ensure they are highlighted correctly when active.

### **Priority 3: Address Remaining Systems**

This priority remains the same, as these areas have likely not been started yet.

1.  **Analyze Shop Drawing & Reporting Systems**
2.  **Implement Client Dashboard**
