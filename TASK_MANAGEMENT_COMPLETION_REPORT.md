## Test Results
```
PASS Hooks src/__tests__/hooks/useTasks.test.ts
  useTasks Hook
    ✓ should fetch tasks on mount
    ✓ should apply filters when fetching tasks
    ✓ should create a new task
    ✓ should update an existing task
    ✓ should delete a task
    ✓ should handle API errors gracefully
    ✓ should calculate correct permissions based on user role
    ✓ should not fetch tasks when user is not authenticated
