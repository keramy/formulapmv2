# RLS Optimization Execution Package

**For AI Agent Execution**

This package contains everything needed to execute RLS policy optimizations on critical Performance Advisor tables. It's designed to be executed by an AI agent with database access.

## üéØ **Mission**

Execute RLS policy optimizations on 17 high-priority Performance Advisor tables to improve database performance by 10-100x for row-level security operations.

## üìã **Execution Checklist**

### **Prerequisites** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Backup system ready
- [ ] Validation queries tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures verified

### **Execution Tasks**
- [ ] **6.1** Optimize core user access tables (3 tables)
- [ ] **6.2** Optimize task management tables (3 tables)  
- [ ] **6.3** Optimize financial and administrative tables (4 tables)
- [ ] **6.4** Optimize system and document tables (4 tables)
- [ ] **6.5** Optimize remaining operational tables (3 tables)

### **Post-Execution** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Validation tests passed
- [ ] Performance improvements verified
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Backup cleanup scheduled

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

1. **Setup**: `node setup-execution-environment.js`
2. **Backup**: `node create-pre-optimization-backup.js`
3. **Execute**: `node execute-optimization-workflow.js`
4. **Validate**: `node validate-optimization-results.js`
