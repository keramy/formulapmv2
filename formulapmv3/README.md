## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Create Next.js 15 Project**
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest formulapm-v3 --typescript --tailwind --app
   cd formulapm-v3
   ```

2. **Copy This Package Contents**
   ```bash
   # Copy all files from this package to your new project
   cp -r formulapmv3/* ./
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # See package-dependencies.md for complete list
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js @tanstack/react-query react-hook-form zod
   # ... etc (see full list in package-dependencies.md)
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment variables
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit with your Supabase credentials
   
   # Apply migrations (includes all V2 + V3 enhancements)
   supabase db push
   ```

5. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìñ How to Use This Package

### For Claude AI Development:
- Start by reading `CLAUDE.md` - contains complete context
- Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_TIMELINE.md` for 8-week development plan
- Reference patterns in `patterns/` folder for working code examples

### For Human Developers:
- Read `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` for business context
- Study `ARCHITECTURE_STACK.md` for technical decisions
- Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for production deployment

## üîë Key Innovations

1. **Dynamic Permission System**: No more fixed roles - admin-configurable permissions
2. **Smart Navigation**: Customizable tabs with "More" dropdown for clean UI
3. **Simplified Authentication**: Multiple focused hooks instead of one 448-line monster
4. **Mobile-First**: Designed for construction sites and work gloves
5. **Performance Focused**: < 500ms navigation, React Query caching

## üéØ Success Criteria

- ‚úÖ Keep all working V2 functionality
- ‚úÖ Add flexible permission system
- ‚úÖ Achieve < 500ms navigation speed
- ‚úÖ Mobile-optimized for field workers
- ‚úÖ Simple, maintainable codebase (no function > 50 lines)

## üìÖ Timeline

**8 weeks to production-ready application**
- Weeks 1-2: Foundation and architecture
- Weeks 3-4: Core features implementation
- Weeks 5-6: Advanced features and admin panel
- Weeks 7-8: Polish, testing, and deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è What Makes V3 Different

| V2 Problems | V3 Solutions |
|------------|--------------|
| 448-line useAuth hook | Multiple focused hooks < 50 lines each |
| Fixed roles requiring code changes | Dynamic permissions via admin panel |
| Slow navigation | Smart caching and optimized routing |
| Complex abstractions | Simple, focused components |
| Desktop-first | Mobile-first for construction sites |
