# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Formula PM 2.0 construction project management system to identify bugs, performance improvements, and optimization opportunities, culminating in a production-ready deployment roadmap. The analysis will systematically evaluate the codebase, infrastructure, security, performance, and deployment readiness to ensure a smooth transition to production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want a comprehensive bug analysis of the application, so that I can prioritize and fix critical issues before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize all potential bugs by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
2. WHEN bugs are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide specific file locations, line numbers, and detailed descriptions
3. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a prioritized bug fix list with estimated effort
4. IF critical bugs are found THEN the system SHALL flag them as production blockers
5. WHEN TypeScript errors are detected THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe solutions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a performance analysis of the application, so that I can optimize bottlenecks and ensure scalable performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance analysis is conducted THEN the system SHALL identify slow database queries and API endpoints
2. WHEN bundle analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify oversized JavaScript bundles and unused dependencies
3. WHEN component analysis is done THEN the system SHALL identify unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations with performance impact estimates
5. IF performance bottlenecks are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by user impact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want a security audit of the application, so that I can ensure the system meets production security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify potential security vulnerabilities in authentication flows
2. WHEN database security is reviewed THEN the system SHALL validate Row Level Security (RLS) policies and permissions
3. WHEN API security is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify unprotected endpoints and authorization gaps
4. WHEN the audit is complete THEN the system SHALL provide security hardening recommendations
5. IF critical security issues are found THEN the system SHALL classify them as production blockers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want an infrastructure and deployment analysis, so that I can prepare a robust production deployment strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL evaluate current deployment configuration and identify gaps
2. WHEN environment setup is reviewed THEN the system SHALL validate environment variables and configuration management
3. WHEN monitoring requirements are assessed THEN the system SHALL recommend logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a step-by-step production deployment checklist
5. IF deployment risks are identified THEN the system SHALL provide mitigation strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want a code quality and maintainability assessment, so that I can ensure long-term sustainability of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code quality analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify code smells, duplications, and architectural inconsistencies
2. WHEN testing coverage is evaluated THEN the system SHALL identify gaps in test coverage and recommend improvements
3. WHEN documentation is reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify missing or outdated documentation
4. WHEN the assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a technical debt prioritization matrix
5. IF maintainability issues are found THEN the system SHALL suggest refactoring strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a comprehensive production roadmap, so that I can understand the timeline and resources needed for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all analyses are complete THEN the system SHALL generate a prioritized roadmap with phases and timelines
2. WHEN the roadmap is created THEN the system SHALL include resource requirements and effort estimates
3. WHEN risks are identified THEN the system SHALL include risk mitigation strategies in the roadmap
4. WHEN the roadmap is finalized THEN the system SHALL provide clear success criteria and milestones
5. IF dependencies exist between tasks THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate task sequencing and prerequisites

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated testing and validation recommendations, so that I can ensure comprehensive test coverage before production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL evaluate current test suite effectiveness
2. WHEN test gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL recommend additional test scenarios and automation
3. WHEN integration testing is reviewed THEN the system SHALL identify missing end-to-end test coverage
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a testing strategy for production readiness
5. IF critical test gaps are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in the production roadmap
