# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive database validation to ensure the local Supabase instance is properly configured, all tables are correctly aligned with the application schema, and core database functionality is working as expected. The validation will cover schema integrity, data consistency, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and basic CRUD operations across all critical tables.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that my local Supabase database schema matches the application requirements, so that I can ensure proper functionality before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database validation is executed THEN the system SHALL verify all required tables exist with correct column definitions
2. WHEN schema validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm all foreign key relationships are properly established
3. WHEN table structure is checked THEN the system SHALL validate all indexes and constraints are correctly applied
4. WHEN data types are verified THEN the system SHALL ensure all columns have the expected data types and constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test basic database operations across all tables, so that I can confirm CRUD functionality is working properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations are tested THEN the system SHALL successfully perform CREATE operations on all critical tables
2. WHEN read operations are executed THEN the system SHALL retrieve data correctly with proper filtering and joins
3. WHEN update operations are performed THEN the system SHALL modify records without data corruption
4. WHEN delete operations are tested THEN the system SHALL remove records while maintaining referential integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate Row Level Security (RLS) policies, so that I can ensure proper data access controls are enforced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies are tested THEN the system SHALL enforce proper access controls for different user roles
2. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL block access to restricted data
3. WHEN role-based queries are executed THEN the system SHALL return only data accessible to that specific role
4. WHEN policy validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm all tables have appropriate RLS policies enabled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test database performance and connection stability, so that I can identify potential issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connection tests are performed THEN the system SHALL establish stable connections to the database
2. WHEN concurrent operations are tested THEN the system SHALL handle multiple simultaneous database requests
3. WHEN query performance is measured THEN the system SHALL identify slow queries that exceed acceptable thresholds
4. WHEN connection pooling is tested THEN the system SHALL properly manage database connections under load

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate data integrity and consistency, so that I can ensure the database maintains accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data integrity checks run THEN the system SHALL verify all foreign key relationships are valid
2. WHEN consistency validation is performed THEN the system SHALL identify any orphaned records or broken relationships
3. WHEN constraint validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm all database constraints are properly enforced
4. WHEN data validation is executed THEN the system SHALL verify that required fields contain valid data
