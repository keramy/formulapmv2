# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance issues in Row Level Security (RLS) policies across the database. The Supabase Performance Advisor has identified that direct calls to `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()` functions within RLS policies cause significant performance degradation. These functions are executed for every row evaluation, creating unnecessary overhead. The optimization involves converting direct function calls to subquery patterns that are evaluated once per query rather than per row.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to optimize RLS policy performance, so that database queries execute faster and reduce server load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS policies contain direct `auth.uid()` calls THEN the system SHALL replace them with `(SELECT auth.uid())` pattern
2. WHEN RLS policies contain direct `auth.jwt()` calls THEN the system SHALL replace them with `(SELECT auth.jwt())` pattern  
3. WHEN RLS policies contain nested SELECT statements THEN the system SHALL clean up the syntax to avoid double nesting
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN all policies SHALL show as "optimized" in validation queries
5. WHEN policies are optimized THEN the system SHALL maintain identical security behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure data security is maintained during optimization, so that access controls remain intact after performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN policies are modified THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing access control logic
2. WHEN optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL verify that user permissions remain unchanged
3. WHEN policies are recreated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same policy names and descriptions
4. WHEN changes are deployed THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capability if issues arise

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive validation of the optimization process, so that I can verify improvements and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization begins THEN the system SHALL create a backup of existing policies
2. WHEN policies are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes for audit purposes
3. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL run validation queries to confirm success
4. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL report the count of optimized vs unoptimized policies
5. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error reporting and remediation steps
