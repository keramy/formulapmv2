# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive refactoring of the Formula PM application. The refactoring aims to improve code quality, security, performance, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality. The UI implementation has been completed by other agents, allowing us to focus on backend, logic, API, and database improvements without UI conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be secure from common vulnerabilities, so that user data and system integrity are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT expose any hardcoded secrets or credentials
2. WHEN dependencies are loaded THEN the system SHALL use only non-vulnerable package versions
3. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL prevent authentication bypass vulnerabilities
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL NOT have memory leaks that could cause system instability
5. IF a security vulnerability is detected THEN the system SHALL log the incident and prevent exploitation

### Requirement 2: Workflow Engine Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflow engine to follow clean architecture patterns, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow operations are executed THEN the system SHALL use the Strategy Pattern for different workflow types
2. WHEN new workflow types are added THEN the system SHALL allow extension without modifying existing code
3. WHEN workflow state changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
4. WHEN workflow errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with proper error messages
5. IF workflow performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds

### Requirement 3: Permission Management Refactoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based permissions to be centrally managed, so that access control is consistent and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL use a centralized permission manager
2. WHEN roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL validate permissions against defined policies
3. WHEN permission changes occur THEN the system SHALL audit all changes with timestamps
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. IF permission conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL resolve them using predefined precedence rules

### Requirement 4: Cost Calculator Enhancement

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want accurate cost calculations with proper error handling, so that project budgets are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases without crashing
2. WHEN calculation inputs are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN calculations complete THEN the system SHALL return results within 1 second
4. WHEN calculation methods change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
5. IF calculation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information

### Requirement 5: API Routes Modernization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent and well-structured API endpoints, so that integration is predictable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions consistently
2. WHEN business logic is executed THEN the system SHALL separate it from API routing logic
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses
4. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP status codes
5. IF API performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 500ms

### Requirement 6: Business Logic Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want business logic separated into dedicated services, so that code is reusable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use dedicated service classes
2. WHEN services are called THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before processing
3. WHEN service errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN services are tested THEN the system SHALL allow unit testing without external dependencies
5. IF service dependencies change THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for flexibility

### Requirement 7: Database Layer Optimization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized database operations, so that application performance is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use optimized query patterns
2. WHEN database connections are made THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN database schema changes THEN the system SHALL handle migrations safely
5. IF database performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain query response times under 100ms

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage and code quality standards, so that the codebase is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL maintain test coverage above 80%
2. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL pass all linting and formatting checks
3. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute all tests within 30 seconds
4. WHEN code reviews are performed THEN the system SHALL meet defined quality standards
5. IF code quality degrades THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment until issues are resolved

### Requirement 9: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring and optimization, so that system performance issues can be identified and resolved proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL monitor key performance metrics
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it for analysis
4. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage automatically

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work after refactoring, so that my workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API endpoints
2. WHEN users access features THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as before
3. WHEN data is accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and format compatibility
4. WHEN integrations are used THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with external systems
5. IF breaking changes are necessary THEN the system SHALL provide migration paths and documentation
