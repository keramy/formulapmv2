## 🎯 Potential Root Causes Identified

Based on the code analysis, the most likely causes of infinite 401 loops are:

### 1. **Token Refresh Race Condition** (HIGH PROBABILITY)
```
Multiple concurrent requests → Token cache expired → 
Multiple refresh operations → Some operations fail → 
Inconsistent token state → 401 errors → Retry loop
```

### 2. **Profile Fetch Failure Loop** (HIGH PROBABILITY)
```
User authentication success → Profile fetch fails (RLS/network) → 
Auth state error → Component retry → Profile fetch fails → Loop
```

### 3. **Token Expiry Edge Case** (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
```
Token cached as valid but actually expired → 
API call with expired token → 401 error → 
Cache not cleared → Same expired token reused → Loop
```

### 4. **State Transition Race Condition** (MEDIUM PROBABILITY)
```
Auth state 'authenticated' → Background token refresh → 
Original API call fails → Error handler triggers → 
State changes to 'error' → Component retry → Loop
```

## 🛠️ Investigation Tools Created

- Real-time console log monitoring
- Pattern detection for infinite loops
- Automatic analysis and reporting
- Manual investigation commands

### 3. **Enhanced Logging Infrastructure**

## 🚀 Next Steps for Live Investigation

### Phase 1: Reproduce the Issue
1. **Login with affected account**
2. **Perform actions that trigger 401 loop** (e.g., create project, fetch data)
3. **Monitor console logs** for patterns using debug script
4. **Identify which scenario** is occurring

### Phase 2: Analyze Log Patterns
1. **Look for repeated request IDs** indicating retry loops
2. **Check token refresh timing** for race conditions
3. **Identify profile fetch failures** and root cause
4. **Monitor state transition sequences** for inconsistencies

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Map actual flow vs expected flow**
2. **Identify the exact failure point** with log evidence
3. **Determine if it's race condition, cache issue, or logic error**
4. **Document specific trigger conditions**

### Phase 4: Targeted Fix
1. **Implement specific fix** for identified root cause
2. **Add safeguards** to prevent similar issues
3. **Test fix thoroughly**
4. **Update documentation**

## 📋 How to Use the Investigation Tools

### 1. Enable Debug Mode
```javascript
// In browser console, run:
window.AuthLoopDebugger.init();
```

### 2. Monitor for Loops
The debug script will automatically:
- Monitor console logs for auth patterns
- Alert when potential loops are detected
- Generate analysis reports

### 3. Manual Investigation Commands
```javascript
// Generate full analysis report
AuthLoopDebugger.generateReport();

// Show recent logs
AuthLoopDebugger.showRecentLogs(20);

// Show detected patterns
AuthLoopDebugger.showPatterns();

// Clear data for fresh investigation
AuthLoopDebugger.clearData();
```

### 4. Console Log Analysis
Look for these patterns in the console:

#### Normal Flow:
```
🔍 [TRACE] getAccessToken - REQUEST START [abc123]
🔐 [timestamp] getAccessToken - using cached token [abc123]
📡 [useProjects:fetchProjects] Making API call
🔐 [verifyAuth:def456] Starting auth verification
✅ [verifyAuth:def456] Auth verification successful
```

#### Problem Flow:
```
🔍 [TRACE] getAccessToken - REQUEST START [abc123]
🔐 [timestamp] getAccessToken - token expiring soon, refreshing [abc123:xyz789]
❌ [timestamp] getAccessToken - token refresh failed [abc123:xyz789]
📡 [useProjects:fetchProjects] Making API call
❌ [verifyAuth:def456] Token verification failed
❌ [useProjects:fetchProjects] API call failed
🔍 [TRACE] getAccessToken - REQUEST START [ghi456] ← REPEAT PATTERN
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

The investigation is complete when:
- ✅ **Exact failure point identified** with log evidence
- ✅ **Root cause documented** with reproduction steps
- ✅ **Fix implemented** and tested
- ✅ **No more infinite 401 loops** in normal usage
- ✅ **Safeguards added** to prevent regression

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Debug Log Format
```
[LEVEL] [timestamp] [component:function] [requestId] message { data }
   └─ call-stack-location
```

### Request ID Tracking
- Each request gets a unique ID (e.g., `abc123`)
- Complex operations get compound IDs (e.g., `abc123:xyz789`)
- IDs are traced through the entire flow

### Timing Metrics
- Operation start/end times
- Duration calculations
- Performance bottleneck identification

### Error Context
- Full error objects with stack traces
- Possible causes listed for each error
- Recovery suggestions

## 🎯 Current Status

**READY FOR LIVE INVESTIGATION**

The system is now fully instrumented with comprehensive debug logging. The next step is to:

1. **Reproduce the infinite 401 loop** in the live environment
2. **Collect and analyze** the debug logs
3. **Identify the exact root cause** from the patterns
4. **Implement a targeted fix** based on the findings

All tools and logging infrastructure are in place to quickly identify and resolve the authentication loop issue.
