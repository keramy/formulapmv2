### New Tables Needed (Simple additions)
1. **project_milestones** (P1.02) - Simple milestone tracking
2. **material_specs** + **scope_material_links** (P1.04) - Material management  
3. **shop_drawings** + **shop_drawing_submissions** + **shop_drawing_reviews** (P1.03) - Shop drawing system
4. **reports** + **report_lines** + **report_line_photos** + **report_shares** (P1.05) - Report system
5. **project_members** (P2.01) - Team management
6. **user_dashboard_preferences** (P2.02) - Dashboard customization
7. **client_dashboard_access** (P2.03) - Client portal access

### Modified Tables (Minor additions)
1. **scope_items** - Add financial fields (P1.06)

### Storage Requirements
- **Supabase Storage buckets**: shop-drawings, report-photos, report-pdfs

## Recommended Implementation Sequence

### Week 1: Foundation & Simple Features
**Days 1-3**: P1.01 (Tasks) + P1.02 (Milestones) **PARALLEL**
**Days 4-6**: P1.04 (Materials) **PARALLEL** with P1.01 completion

### Week 2: Complex Workflow Features  
**Days 7-11**: P1.03 (Shop Drawings) - Complex but high value
**Days 12-15**: P1.05 (Reports) - Complex PDF generation

### Week 3: Enhancement & Integration
**Days 16-19**: P1.06 (Scope Enhancement) + P2.01 (Team Management)
**Days 20-21**: Testing and P1 integration cleanup

### Week 4: Client & Dashboard Features
**Days 22-25**: P2.02 (Dashboard Design) - Role-based dashboards
**Days 26-29**: P2.03 (Client Dashboard) - External client access
**Day 30**: Final testing and deployment preparation

2. **P1.05 Reports**: PDF generation, server resources
3. **Excel Integration**: File parsing, data validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with simple features to build confidence
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use proven libraries (react-pdf, xlsx)
- Extensive testing with real data

## Architecture Benefits

### Building on Solid Foundation
‚úÖ **Clean Authentication**: Modern verifyAuth patterns
‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration
‚úÖ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test infrastructure
‚úÖ **Simplified Architecture**: Focus on core business value
‚úÖ **Database Schema**: 85% of requirements already met

### Technical Advantages
- **Incremental Development**: Each P1 task is self-contained
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple tasks can run simultaneously
- **Proven Patterns**: Existing patterns for new features
- **Test Coverage**: Framework ready for comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** this master plan
2. **Start with P1.01 & P1.02** (can run in parallel)
3. **Database migration** for milestone tracking (simple)
4. **Begin implementation** following prioritized sequence

The V3 implementation builds upon the excellent foundation established in Waves 1-3, with most database requirements already met and a clear path to comprehensive project management functionality.
