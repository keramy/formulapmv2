# Task: Formula PM V3 Complete Implementation

## Type: New Feature
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 6-7 weeks  
**Subagents**: 7 specialized agents across 5 phases
**Approach**: Hybrid (Parallel within phases, Sequential between phases)

## Request Analysis
**Original Request**: "Complete V3 implementation with corrected role system and production-ready features"
**Objective**: Transform Formula PM into a fully functional project management system with real data, proper 6-role system, and all V3 features
**Over-Engineering Check**: Following Kiro's established patterns and proven architecture - minimum viable approach confirmed

## Master Plan Reference
**Full Details**: `V3_IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md`

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation Correction & Role Migration (2 weeks)
- **Focus**: Fix role system discrepancy (13→6 roles) and eliminate mock data
- **Agents**: Agent A (Role Migration), Agent B (Mock Data Elimination)
- **Critical**: Must complete before other phases can proceed
- **Task Document**: `TASK_PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md`

### Phase 2: Core Business Features (2 weeks)
- **Focus**: Task management, milestones, material workflows, shop drawings
- **Agents**: Agent C (Task/Milestones), Agent D (Materials/Approvals)
- **Parallel Execution**: Two agents work simultaneously
- **Task Document**: `TASK_PHASE_2_CORE_FEATURES.md`

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Reports (1 week)
- **Focus**: Reporting system, financial tracking, dashboard refinements
- **Agents**: Agent E (Reporting/Analytics)
- **Dependencies**: Requires Phase 2 completion
- **Task Document**: `TASK_PHASE_3_ENHANCED_FEATURES.md`

### Phase 4: Team Management & Client Features (1 week)
- **Focus**: Project teams, client portal, navigation integration
- **Agents**: Agent F (User Experience)
- **Dependencies**: Core features must be operational
- **Task Document**: `TASK_PHASE_4_TEAM_CLIENT.md`

### Phase 5: Final Testing & Production Readiness (1 week)
- **Focus**: Integration testing, deployment prep, documentation
- **Agents**: Agent G (Quality Assurance)
- **Dependencies**: All features complete
- **Task Document**: `TASK_PHASE_5_PRODUCTION.md`

## Technical Foundation (From Kiro's Work)

### ✅ Already Completed
- Authentication system (JWT tokens fixed)
- API standardization (withAuth patterns)
- Security controls (100% implemented)
- Testing framework (88% pass rate)
- Database schema (95% production ready)

### ❌ Still Required
- Role system migration (13→6 roles)
- Mock data replacement with real APIs
- V3 business feature implementation
- Client portal functionality
- 7 new database tables

## Critical Patterns to Follow

### Database Queries (Performance Critical)
```sql
-- ✅ ALWAYS USE
USING (user_id = (SELECT auth.uid()));

-- ❌ NEVER USE (10-100x slower)
USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### API Development (Required Pattern)
```typescript
// ✅ ALWAYS USE withAuth
export const GET = withAuth(async (request, { user, profile }) => {
  return createSuccessResponse(data);
}, { permission: 'permission.name' });
```

## Success Criteria
- **Role System**: 6 roles fully implemented and migrated
- **Performance**: <200ms response time maintained
- **Security**: All controls operational (100%)
- **Testing**: 90%+ test pass rate
- **Features**: All V3 features functional with real data
- **Production**: Successfully deployed and documented

## Risk Management
1. **Role Migration**: Backup scripts, maintenance window, rollback plan
2. **Performance**: Follow RLS patterns, proper indexing, monitoring
3. **Data Integrity**: Validation scripts, audit logs, constraint testing
4. **Security**: Use established patterns, penetration testing, role validation

## Coordinator Instructions

### Phase Sequencing
1. **Start Phase 1 immediately** - Both agents can work in parallel
2. **Phase 2 begins after** - Role system migration complete
3. **Phase 3-4 can overlap** - Different feature areas
4. **Phase 5 is final** - Requires all features complete

### Communication Protocol
- Daily status updates from active agents
- Phase completion reviews before proceeding
- Blocker escalation within 4 hours
- Pattern compliance verification at each phase

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must meet success metrics before next phase
- Code review focusing on pattern compliance
- Performance testing after each major feature
- Security validation at phase boundaries
