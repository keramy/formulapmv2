# Task: Fix Dashboard Access After Login

## Type: Bug Fix
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Subagents**: 2
**Approach**: Sequential

## Request Analysis
**Original Request**: "im getting this error when i login. Access Required Please log in to view the dashboard. and also check errorlog file C:\Users\Kerem\Desktop\formulapmv2\errorlog.md and fix the issues."
**Objective**: Fix authentication flow so users can access dashboard after successful login and resolve any errors in errorlog.md
**Over-Engineering Check**: Focused bug fix for session management and route protection - no new features

## Context
User can successfully log in with the fixed @formulapm.com credentials but receives "Access Required - Please log in to view the dashboard" error when trying to access the dashboard. This indicates a session management or route protection issue rather than a credential problem.

## Subagent Assignments

### Wave 1: Investigation & Error Analysis
#### Subagent 1: debug - Analyze Error Log and Authentication Flow
```
TASK_NAME: analyze_dashboard_access_errors
TASK_GOAL: Identify root cause of dashboard access denial after successful login
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check errorlog.md file for specific error details and stack traces
2. Debug authentication flow from login success to dashboard access attempt
3. Verify session management and auth state persistence
4. Check middleware and route protection logic
5. Test actual loginâ†’dashboard navigation flow
6. Document exact point where authentication fails
7. Identify if issue is client-side (auth state) or server-side (session/middleware)
CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT modify any authentication logic during investigation
- Focus on post-login authentication flow, not login credentials
- Document exact error messages and flow steps
DEPENDENCIES: None
```

### Wave 2: Fix Implementation
#### Subagent 2: fullstack - Fix Dashboard Access and Session Management
```
TASK_NAME: fix_dashboard_access_flow
TASK_GOAL: Implement fixes to allow dashboard access after successful login
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix identified authentication flow issues from Wave 1 investigation
2. Ensure session persistence between login and dashboard access
3. Fix route protection middleware if blocking legitimate users
4. Verify auth state management in React components
5. Test complete loginâ†’dashboard flow for all user roles
6. Ensure proper redirect handling after successful authentication
7. Fix any issues found in errorlog.md
CONSTRAINTS:
- Preserve existing authentication security measures
- Maintain role-based access control
- Fix only the session/access issues, not authentication logic
- Test with all @formulapm.com accounts
DEPENDENCIES: Wave 1 investigation results
```

## Technical Details
**Files to investigate**:
- `C:\Users\Kerem\Desktop\formulapmv2\errorlog.md` - Error details
- `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection logic
- `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.tsx` - Client-side auth protection
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Authentication state management
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard component
- `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login redirect logic

**Common issues to check**:
- Session not persisting after login redirect
- Middleware blocking authenticated users
- Auth state not updating after login success
- Incorrect redirect URL after authentication
- Missing auth context provider

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can access dashboard immediately after successful login
- [ ] No "Access Required" errors for authenticated users
- [ ] All errors in errorlog.md are resolved
- [ ] Authentication flow works for all @formulapm.com user roles
- [ ] Session persists correctly between login and dashboard
- [ ] Proper role-based access to dashboard features

## Error Context
User reports:
- Can log in successfully (credentials work)
- Gets "Access Required - Please log in to view the dashboard" after login
- Error log file exists with specific error details
- Issue started after recent authentication credential fixes

## Authentication Flow Expected
1. User enters credentials on /auth/login
2. Supabase authentication succeeds
3. User session/auth state is established
4. User is redirected to /dashboard
5. Dashboard should load with user-specific content
6. **CURRENTLY FAILING**: Step 5 shows "Access Required" instead
