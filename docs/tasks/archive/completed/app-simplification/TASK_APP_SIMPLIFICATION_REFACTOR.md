# Task: Simplify Formula PM Application

## Type: Refactoring
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Subagents**: 4
**Approach**: Incremental

## Request Analysis
**Original Request**: "read this file C:\Users\Kerem\Desktop\formulapmv2\simplfyapp.md . We will simplfy our app. Then we will fix the issues permanently.If feature is needed we will add in future."
**Objective**: Refactor Formula PM into a simpler, more maintainable application focusing on core user journeys
**Over-Engineering Check**: Removing complex features (purchase, subcontractor) to focus on essential project management

## Technical Details
**Files to modify**: 
- src/app/layout.tsx (new layout integration)
- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx (owner dashboard)
- src/app/projects/* (new project pages)
- src/components/layouts/* (new layout components)
- src/components/dashboard/owner/* (new dashboard components)
- src/components/projects/* (new project components)

**Files to remove**:
