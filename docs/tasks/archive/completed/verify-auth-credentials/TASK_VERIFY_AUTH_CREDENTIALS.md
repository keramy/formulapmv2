# Task: Verify and Fix Authentication Credentials

## Type: Bug Fix
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Subagents**: 2
**Approach**: Sequential

## Request Analysis
**Original Request**: "can you check the usernames and passwords please ? Last time i tried to log in it said incorrect username or password"
**Objective**: Verify authentication credentials and ensure documented test accounts work correctly
**Over-Engineering Check**: Simple credential verification and fix - no new features or systems

## Context
User is experiencing authentication failures with "incorrect username or password" errors. Need to verify that test accounts exist in the database and that documented passwords match actual passwords.

## Subagent Assignments

### Wave 1: Investigation
#### Subagent 1: debug - Verify Authentication Credentials
```
TASK_NAME: verify_auth_credentials
TASK_GOAL: Investigate and document the actual state of authentication credentials in the system
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Check if documented test accounts exist in auth.users table
2. Verify user_profiles entries for each test account
3. List all existing test accounts with their email addresses and roles
4. Check authentication configuration and password requirements
5. Test authentication with documented credentials to confirm failure
6. Document exact error messages and authentication flow
CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT modify any user data during investigation
- DO NOT expose actual password hashes in reports
- Focus only on test accounts (not production data)
DEPENDENCIES: None
```

### Wave 2: Fix Implementation
#### Subagent 2: fullstack - Fix Authentication Credentials
```
TASK_NAME: fix_auth_credentials
TASK_GOAL: Ensure all documented test accounts work with password 'password123'
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create or update test accounts as needed based on investigation
2. Ensure all documented accounts exist with correct emails
3. Set password to 'password123' for all test accounts
4. Verify user_profiles are properly linked to auth users
5. Test authentication for each user role (admin, PM, client, subcontractor)
6. Update documentation if any email addresses have changed
CONSTRAINTS:
- Preserve existing user data where possible
- Use consistent password 'password123' for all test accounts
- Maintain role-based access control settings
- Follow existing authentication patterns
DEPENDENCIES: Wave 1 investigation results
```

## Technical Details
**Files to check**:
- Supabase auth.users table
- user_profiles table
- `.env.local` for auth configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` for documented credentials
- `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` for test account list

**Expected test accounts**:
- Admin: `david.admin@premiumbuild.com`
- Company Owner: `robert.construction@premiumbuild.com`
- PM: `lisa.thompson@premiumbuild.com`
- Client: `william.luxury@highendliving.com`
- Subcontractor: `michael.electrical@sparkmaster.com`

**Authentication flow**:
1. User enters email/password
2. Supabase auth.signInWithPassword() called
3. Auth token returned on success
4. User profile fetched from user_profiles table

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All documented test accounts can log in successfully
- [ ] Password 'password123' works for all test accounts
- [ ] Each user role can access appropriate dashboard/portal
- [ ] No authentication errors when using correct credentials
- [ ] Documentation matches actual working credentials

## Common Issues to Check
1. **Missing auth.users entries** - Account doesn't exist in authentication table
2. **Missing user_profiles** - Auth user exists but no profile data
3. **Password mismatch** - Different password than documented
4. **Email case sensitivity** - Email stored differently than documented
5. **RLS policies** - Row Level Security blocking authentication

## Status Tracking (For Coordinator)

### Wave 1: Investigation
- [ ] Subagent 1: verify_auth_credentials - Status: âŸ³ IN_PROGRESS | ðŸ“Š AWAITING_EVALUATION | âœ“ APPROVED | ðŸ”„ RE-DELEGATED
  - Score: __/100 | Notes: ____________

### Wave 2: Fix Implementation
- [ ] Subagent 2: fix_auth_credentials - Status: âŸ³ IN_PROGRESS | ðŸ“Š AWAITING_EVALUATION | âœ“ APPROVED | ðŸ”„ RE-DELEGATED
  - Score: __/100 | Notes: ____________

### Overall Progress
- **Progress**: 0% (0/2 tasks approved)
- **Blocked**: None
- **Re-delegated**: 0
- **Current Wave**: 1
- **Next Action**: Begin credential investigation

### Decisions Made
- Sequential approach chosen for clear problem identification before fixes
- Focus on test accounts only to avoid production data risks
- Standardize on 'password123' for all test accounts
