# Task: Local App Testing & Validation with Realistic Construction Data

## Type: Testing/Validation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 7-10 hours (1-2 days)  
**Subagents**: 3
**Approach**: Sequential

## Request Analysis
**Original Request**: "i want to run the app locally to see the product. use app,give feedback,add new features or test the current features.Want to make sure everything works well. i want to focus on testing. Ä± want to be able to create projects,tasks, and frankly to see some data so i can understand how things work. I would like to have construction project including millwork,consturction, and electricity. create at least 6 different projects,include 15 team member or more if needed. show some pm's working on multiple projects. create these projects scope lists,shopdrawings,materials as well. also add tasks"

**Objective**: Set up local development environment with comprehensive realistic construction data for thorough testing and validation of Formula PM functionality

**Over-Engineering Check**: Focused on practical testing with real-world scenarios - minimum viable approach for maximum validation value
