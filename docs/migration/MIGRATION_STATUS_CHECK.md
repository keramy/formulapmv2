## 🔍 Verification After Migration

Run these queries to verify everything worked:

```sql
-- Check if indexes were created
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_%' 
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Check if monitoring functions were created
SELECT routine_name 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name IN (
    'monitor_database_connections',
    'connection_pool_health_check',
    'monitor_index_performance'
);

-- Test connection monitoring
SELECT * FROM database_connection_stats;
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful migration:
- **30+ database indexes** created for performance
- **Connection monitoring functions** available
